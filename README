Hugor - A portable Hugo engine
Written and maintained by Nikos Chantziaras <realnc@gmail.com>

Hugor is a "Hugo Runner", meaning a program in which you can load and
play adventure games created with Kent Tessmanâ€™s Hugo authoring system:

Hugor supports all graphics, sound and music formats of the Hugo engine.
Video is fully supported in the Linux and Windows versions.  In order to
be able to play videos, you will need the correct GStreamer
plugins/codecs installed.  The gstreamer-libav (GStreamer 1.x) or
gstreamer-ffmpeg (GStreamer 0.10) plugin should be a safe bet.

For audio support, SDL and SDL_mixer are needed.  Both SDL1 as well as
SDL2 are supported.

(For runtime library dependencies of the distributed Linux binary, please
consult the README.linux-bin file.)

Hugor runs on all current major operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X and
Microsoft Windows).  You can find up to date, ready to run binaries at:

The source code is hosted at the following Git repository:

Compiling from source
=====================

If you wish to build from source, you will need the development packages
for the Qt library (version 4.6 or later, 5.x is also supported) and
SDL_mixer (1.2 is used by default, but version 2.0 is also supported).
To get correct support for MOD and MP3 music, SDL_mixer needs to have
been built with modplug and libmad support.

For video support, you will also need GStreamer.  Either 0.10.x or 1.x
will work.  By default, 1.x is assumed.  You can choose 0.10 instead if
your system doesn't yet provide the newer gstreamer libraries; see below
on how to do that.

Once all dependencies are installed, you can build Hugor with the
following commands:

  qmake
  make -jN

Substitute the 'N' in '-jN' with the amount of CPUs or cores in your
system in order to utilize all of them for a faster compilation process.
(If you are not using GNU Make, then the -j option might not be supported.
If that's the case, simply omit that option altogether.)

By default, SDL_mixer 1.2 is used.  To build against SDL 2 instead, use:

  qmake CONFIG+=sdl2

To disable audio support completely, use:

  qmake CONFIG+=disable-audio

If you want to build against GStreamer 0.10 instead of 1.x, call qmake
with:

  qmake CONFIG+=gstreamer-0.10

Note that SDL is still needed for video support, even if audio is
disabled.  SDL1 is assumed, unless you specify CONFIG+=sdl2.

If you want to disable video support:

  qmake CONFIG+=disable-video

If you want to specify multiple CONFIG options, don't forget to quote
them.  For example, to build without audio support but with video support
and use gstreamer 0.10 and SDL2:

  qmake CONFIG+="disable-audio sdl2 gstreamer-0.10"

If all goes well, you will find an executable in the current directory
which you can copy somewhere else and run it however you want.
